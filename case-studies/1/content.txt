## Case Study: Reviving a Dormant South African E-Commerce Store

**From Zero Sales to R119k in Revenue in Just 3 Months with Strategic Google Ads Optimization**

---

### **Overview**

A South Africa–based e-commerce store in the **bedding and furniture** category was struggling to survive. The account had been dormant for 3 months, running loss-making ads with no proper tracking, no conversions, and zero organic traffic. Within just **3 months**, I transformed this stagnant business into a **revenue powerhouse**, generating **R119,000** in sales from an ad spend of only **R7.86k**.

---

### **Client Background**

* **Industry:** Bedding & Furniture
* **Location:** South Africa
* **Business Model:** E-commerce (WordPress WooCommerce)
* **Initial Challenge:** 10–15% loss, zero organic traffic, poorly set up Google Ads campaigns, no conversion tracking

---

### **The Challenge**

When I took over the account, the **Google Ads setup was broken**:

* Managed by the store owner using Google’s default suggestions (low targeting precision)
* No conversion tracking or e-commerce event tracking
* No remarketing strategy
* Only basic Search campaigns with poor targeting
* Merchant Center not set up, no Shopping campaigns

The store was spending money without measurable ROI and was in danger of shutting down its ad spend entirely.

### **My Approach**

#### **1. Full Account & Tracking Overhaul**

* Stopped all existing campaigns immediately
* Implemented **Google Tag Manager** for e-commerce event tracking
* Set up **GA4** for complete data visibility
* Configured **Google Merchant Center** and built product feeds

#### **2. Business & Market Research**

* Studied client’s products, best-sellers, and category structure
* Conducted competitor analysis in the South African bedding market
* Identified high-intent buyer segments and geographic hot spots

#### **3. Campaign Strategy**

* **Performance Max Campaign** for full catalog reach
* **Search Campaigns** for top-performing, high-margin products
* **Standard Shopping Campaign** for visibility across the product range
* Used compelling call-to-action messaging targeting urgent purchase intent
* Distributed budget equally at first, then reallocated to top-performing campaigns

#### **4. Optimization & Scaling**

* Monitored conversion data daily
* Shifted budget to high-performing cities/regions
* Reduced spend on underperforming channels (e.g., Shopping when ROI dropped)
* Used **Target CPA bidding** after collecting enough conversion data
* Implemented **ad extensions** and **negative keywords** to improve CTR and reduce wasted spend

### **Challenges & Insights**

One key challenge was **local buying behavior** — in South Africa, most online purchases occur in the first half of the month. Initially, I launched the campaign in the **last 10 days** of the month and saw slow traction. Once I learned this insight, I shifted **heavier spend to the first 15 days**, significantly boosting conversion volume.

### **Results** *(After 3 Months)*

* **Ad Spend:** R7,860
* **Conversions:** 29
* **Cost per Conversion:** R271
* **Conversion Value:** R119,000
* **ROI:** ~15x
* **Business Health:** From loss-making to profitable, long-term growth secured

### **Client Feedback**

> *“I’m beyond happy with the results. My store’s revenue has come back to life, and I finally have confidence in my ad spend. This is the best our Google Ads have ever performed.”*

### **Key Takeaways**

* **Accurate tracking before spending** is non-negotiable for effective optimization
* Understanding **local buying patterns** can significantly improve budget efficiency
* Combining **Performance Max** for scale with **Search** for precision is powerful for high-ticket products
