**From $1K to 57 new patients — scaling a pain clinic’s growth with smart Google Ads.**


**Client:** SPOT Pain Management Clinic  
**Location:** Plano, Longview, Arlington, Tyler, Texas  
**Campaign Type:** Google Search Ads (Conversion Focused)  
**Initial Budget:** $1,000/month  
**Goal:** Generate quality, high-intent leads that convert into paying patients.

----------

### **Background**

In June 2023, SPOT Pain Management Clinic approached me with no prior experience in paid advertising. This was their first-ever Google Ads campaign, and their expectations were both high and naive — believing that spending $1,000 would instantly bring in 100 new patients.

The challenge was clear:

-   No account history or data
    
-   Limited budget for a competitive medical niche
    
-   Client’s lack of marketing knowledge
    
-   Strict Google Ads policies for medical terms
    

----------

### **Phase 1: Building From Scratch (June – September 2023)**

**Strategy:**  
I began with competitor and market research to understand what worked in the local pain management market. Then I launched **search campaigns targeting service-based, high-intent keywords**, supported by dedicated landing pages.

-   Started with **Max Clicks + Responsive Search Ads** to collect data quickly
    
-   Structured ad groups by service type (e.g., regenerative medicine, minimally invasive procedures)
    
-   Targeted a **30-mile radius** around each city for maximum coverage
    

**Key Milestones:**

-   First month: 3–5 paying customers from a $1,000 budget
    
-   August: Client insisted on **Call-Only Ads** to get “real patients” on the phone
    
-   Results: Good ROAS but poor conversion due to the client’s weak follow-up skills
    

**Solution:**  
I personally hired a **Virtual Assistant (VA)** to call every lead, recovering **13 paying customers** from otherwise wasted inquiries.

----------

### **Phase 2: Turning the Corner (October – November 2023)**

By October, I had shifted from broad targeting to **high-intent service keywords** despite higher CPCs ($10–$40 per click).

-   October: Achieved a **28.1% conversion rate**, but profitability still needed improvement
    
-   November: Breakthrough month — **41 leads** generated, **23 paying customers**
    
-   Confidence in targeting and ad structure grew significantly
    

----------

### **Phase 3: Scaling & Crisis Management (December 2023)**

With proven results, I increased the budget from $1,000 to $2,500 to accelerate growth.

-   December: $3.46K spent → 87 leads → 57 paying customers
    
-   Challenge: Google Ads account **suspended** due to use of medical procedure terms in ad copy (e.g., “Kyphoplasty,” “MILD,” “COOLIEF”)
    
-   Suspension lasted 15–25 days
    

**Pivot:**  
While resolving the suspension, I leveraged **organic marketing** with help from a colleague, generating **5–7 paying customers** without ad spend.  
I revised ad copy and landing pages to meet Google compliance, restoring the account.

----------

### **Phase 4: Precision Under Budget Cuts (January 2024)**

In January, the client went on vacation and reduced the budget to $1,500.

-   Spent $1,480 → 53 leads generated
    
-   Maintained both **lead volume and quality** despite lower spend
    
-   Campaigns resumed normal performance within **10 days** post-suspension
    

----------

### **Core Strategic Moves**

1.  **Competitor & Market Research First** – Mapped out competitor offers, ad structures, and keyword gaps before launch.
    
2.  **High-Intent Service Segmentation** – Separate ad groups + landing pages for each service.
    
3.  **Broad-to-Precise Targeting Transition** – Started broad for data, then tightened targeting for quality.
    
4.  **Budget Reallocation to Winners** – Shifted spend toward top-performing services and keywords.
    
5.  **Crisis Management During Suspension** – Leveraged organic marketing + compliance fixes to keep revenue flowing.
    
6.  **Lead Conversion Support** – Added a VA to follow up with inquiries, turning lost leads into paying customers.
