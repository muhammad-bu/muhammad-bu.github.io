 **Scaling First Home Buyer & Refinance Leads with Meta Ads**

*  **Client:** Multi Choice Mortgage 
*  **Industry:** Financial Services 
*  **Location:** Australia (NSW, VIC, QLD) 
*  **Campaign Type:** Meta Ads (Facebook & Instagram) 
*  **Goal:** Generate 30+ high-quality, exclusive leads per month for First Home Buyer and Refinancing offers.

### **The Client & The Challenge**

In March 2024, Multi Choice Mortgage, a provider of First Home Buyer loans and Refinancing options, approached us with a clear objective: to kick off their digital lead generation strategy. This was their first-ever experience with paid advertising. They needed a structured approach to generate a consistent volume of high-quality leads in a highly competitive Australian financial services market, all while maintaining a sustainable cost per lead (CPL).

### **My Strategic Execution**

We implemented a 3-phase strategic approach to methodically test, optimize, and scale their Meta Ads campaigns.

#### **Phase 1: Testing & Validation**

We began by launching campaigns with a modest budget of $30/day per campaign to gather initial data. Our focus was on testing various creative formats and targeting strategies to find what resonated most with potential clients.

-   **Campaign Structure:** We segmented campaigns by state (NSW, Victoria, QLD) to tailor messaging to local regulations and grants.
    
-   **Ad Formats:** We tested static ads and different landing pages built with GHL, as well as Meta Lead Forms.
    
-   **Audience Targeting:** We created distinct audience segments for First Home Buyers (age 18–50) and Refinancing (age 25–48), targeting interests like 'Mortgage Loans' and 'First Home Owner Grant.'
    

**Result:** The First Home Buyer campaigns immediately stood out, significantly outperforming refinancing campaigns in both CPL and lead quality.

#### **Phase 2: Optimization & Scaling**

With clear winners identified, we moved to streamline the campaign and reduce the acquisition cost.

-   We aggressively scaled the winning First Home Buyer ad sets and paused all underperformers.
    
-   Based on lead quality feedback, we paused the underperforming GHL landing pages and focused exclusively on Meta Lead Forms, which generated a higher quality of lead.
    
-   During this phase, we optimized the CPL from the initial **$15** down to **$10–$12**.
    

#### **Phase 3: Creative Evolution & Breakthrough**

We recognized that even better performance could be unlocked with more engaging creative. We worked closely with the client to produce dynamic content.

-   We encouraged the client to record simple, direct-to-camera videos explaining their offers.
    
-   We professionally edited the videos, adding headers, footers, background music, and subtitles to maximize engagement.
    
-   We continued running our most successful static ads alongside the new video creatives.
    

**Result:** The launch of the new video ads marked our biggest breakthrough. The CPL dropped to just **$5**, representing a **50% improvement** from the previous phase and a **66% drop** from our initial cost.

### **Ad Messaging & Creative**

We developed highly targeted messaging that spoke directly to the client's core audience.

**Best Performing Static Ad Copy (Example):**

> 🏡 **Your Dream Home Awaits: Get closer to your first home with just $13K of your own savings!** 
> Benefit from first home buyer government grants offering up to **$30K** cash towards your purchase and the First Home Guarantee, which waives Lender Mortgage Insurance **(LMI)**. 
> Click **"Learn More"** to Discover Your Eligibility Today!

**Best Performing Video Content (Summary):**

-   Spoke directly to the camera, building trust and credibility.
    
-   Clearly covered key benefits: a 5% deposit and no LMI.
    
-   Explained eligibility requirements (e.g., Australian citizenship) to pre-qualify leads.
    

### **Core Strategic Moves**

-   **Structured Testing:** The phased approach allowed us to methodically test and validate different platforms and creative formats without wasting budget.
    
-   **Data-Driven Decisions:** We quickly dropped underperforming creatives and focused on the Meta Lead Form, which proved to be a superior format for lead quality.
    
-   **Creative Evolution:** The transition from static images to professionally edited video content was the key to a dramatic reduction in CPL.
    
-   **Sophisticated Tracking:** We integrated with the client’s CRM (via GHL) and used Offline Conversions to optimize our campaigns based on true lead quality, not just CPL.
