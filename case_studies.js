The account had been dormant for 3 months, running loss-making ads with no proper tracking, no conversions, and zero organic traffic. Within just **3 months**, I transformed this stagnant business into a **revenue powerhouse**, generating **R119,000** in sales from an ad spend of only **R7.86k**.\n\n---\n\n### **Client Background**\n\n* **Industry:** Bedding & Furniture\n* **Location:** South Africa\n* **Business Model:** E-commerce (WordPress WooCommerce)\n* **Initial Challenge:** 10–15% loss, zero organic traffic, poorly set up Google Ads campaigns, no conversion tracking\n\n---\n\n### **The Challenge**\n\nWhen I took over the account, the **Google Ads setup was broken**:\n\n* Managed by the store owner using Google’s default suggestions (low targeting precision)\n* No conversion tracking or e-commerce event tracking\n* No remarketing strategy\n* Only basic Search campaigns with poor targeting\n* Merchant Center not set up, no Shopping campaigns\n\nThe store was spending money without measurable ROI and was in danger of shutting down its ad spend entirely.\n\n---\n\n### **My Approach**\n\n#### **1. Full Account & Tracking Overhaul**\n\n* Stopped all existing campaigns immediately\n* Implemented **Google Tag Manager** for e-commerce event tracking\n* Set up **GA4** for complete data visibility\n* Configured **Google Merchant Center** and built product feeds\n\n#### **2. Business & Market Research**\n\n* Studied client’s products, best-sellers, and category structure\n* Conducted competitor analysis in the South African bedding market\n* Identified high-intent buyer segments and geographic hot spots\n\n#### **3. Campaign Strategy**\n\n* **Performance Max Campaign** for full catalog reach\n* **Search Campaigns** for top-performing, high-margin products\n* **Standard Shopping Campaign** for visibility across the product range\n* Used compelling call-to-action messaging targeting urgent purchase intent\n* Distributed budget equally at first, then reallocated to top-performing campaigns\n\n#### **4. Optimization & Scaling**\n\n* Monitored conversion data daily\n* Shifted budget to high-performing cities/regions\n* Reduced spend on underperforming channels (e.g., Shopping when ROI dropped)\n* Used **Target CPA bidding** after collecting enough conversion data\n* Implemented **ad extensions** and **negative keywords** to improve CTR and reduce wasted spend\n\n---\n\n### **Challenges & Insights**\n\nOne key challenge was **local buying behavior** — in South Africa, most online purchases occur in the first half of the month. Initially, I launched the campaign in the **last 10 days** of the month and saw slow traction. Once I learned this insight, I shifted **heavier spend to the first 15 days**, significantly boosting conversion volume.\n\n---\n\n### **Results** *(After 3 Months)*\n\n* **Ad Spend:** R7,860\n* **Conversions:** 29\n* **Cost per Conversion:** R271\n* **Conversion Value:** R119,000\n* **ROI:** ~15x\n* **Business Health:** From loss-making to profitable, long-term growth secured\n\n---\n\n### **Client Feedback**\n\n> *“I’m beyond happy with the results. My store’s revenue has come back to life, and I finally have confidence in my ad spend. This is the best our Google Ads have ever performed.”*\n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaways**\n\n* **Accurate tracking before spending** is non-negotiable for effective optimization\n* Understanding **local buying patterns** can significantly improve budget efficiency\n* Combining **Performance Max** for scale with **Search** for precision is powerful for high-ticket products\n\n---\n\n### **Impact**\n\nThis project didn’t just generate R119k in revenue — it **revived a dying online business** and turned it into a profitable operation. The client has now retained me on a **monthly basis** to manage their ongoing paid media strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Proof Snapshot**\n\n![Babmoo stats](images/Babmoo%20stats)\n\n---\n\n### **Visual Ideas to Enhance the Case Study Page**\n\n1. **Before vs. After Metrics Graphic** – Simple Canva chart showing “Before: R0 revenue / After: R119k revenue.”\n2. **Results Highlight Boxes** – Bold numbers like *+29 Conversions*, *15x ROI*, *R271 CPA*.\n3. **Campaign Timeline Graphic** – Week 1: Tracking → Week 2: Launch → Month 3: R119k revenue."
